An uncomplicated winter, a spring with no frost or disease, and a hot, very dry summer allowed our grapes to fully ripen (yes, we actually had summer last year in England, yay!). With those almost perfect conditions, Nico has managed to grow an excellent quality crop of Pinot Noir, which allowed us to make again the pale and refreshing rosé everybody loves!</p>\n<p style=""text-align: left;"">Our<strong> Pinot Noir Rosé</strong> is always the most popular of our wines and the 2020 vintage was considered one of the best rosé in the world, having won a Silver Medal at the Global Rosé Masters, an international competition organised by TheDrinksBusiness magazine. Every year, our Pinot Noir Rosé sells out before the following vintage is ready - no matter how much we make.</p>\n<p style=""text-align: left;"">This is a very pale, dry and refreshing rosé, with delicate flavours of raspberry, passionfruit and fresh peach.
