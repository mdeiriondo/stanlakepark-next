# Stanlake Park Wine Estate - Reimagined 🍷

A high-end digital experience redesign for **Stanlake Park Wine Estate**, merging historical heritage with a modern luxury interface ("Modern Heritage").

## **🚀 Technical Excellence**

This project is built on the absolute cutting edge of the React ecosystem:

Framework: Next.js 16.1.6 (App Router) using Turbopack for ultra-fast development cycles.

Styling Engine: Tailwind CSS 4.0 (CSS-first engine), providing a zero-runtime CSS footprint.

Animations: Custom-built "Reveal" system using the Intersection Observer API and native CSS transitions for maximum performance.

Typography: Playfair Display (Serif) for editorial elegance and Inter (Sans) for modern legibility.

Icons: Lucide React for a clean, consistent iconography.

✨ Key Design Features

Luxury Editorial Hero: A split-screen experience featuring the historic "1166" brand mark and cinematic Ken Burns imagery.

Fluid Custom Cursor: A sophisticated "Ring & Dot" pointer with mix-blend-mode: difference, ensuring high visibility and brand personality across all screen sections.

Winery/Wedding Duality: Seamless atmosphere switching, adapting the UI from a warm winery palette to a clean, ethereal wedding aesthetic.

Experience Hub: An interactive, accordion-style booking interface for tours, seasonal events, and lifestyle experiences.
