# Stanlake Park Wine Estate - Reimagined 🍷

A high-end digital experience redesign for **Stanlake Park Wine Estate**, merging historical heritage with a modern luxury interface ("Modern Heritage").

## **🚀 Technical Excellence**

This project is built on the absolute cutting edge of the React ecosystem:

- **Framework:** [Next.js 16.1.6](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) using **Turbopack** for ultra-fast development cycles and improved HMR.
- **Styling Engine:** [Tailwind CSS 4.0](https://tailwindcss.com/) (CSS-first engine), providing a zero-runtime CSS footprint and simplified configuration.
- **Animations:** Custom-built "Reveal" system using the _Intersection Observer API_ and native CSS transitions for maximum performance and smooth scroll interactions.
- **Typography:** [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display) (Serif) for editorial elegance and [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) (Sans) for modern legibility.
- **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) for a clean, consistent, and lightweight iconography.

## **✨ Key Design Features**

- **Luxury Editorial Hero:** A split-screen experience featuring the historic "1166" brand mark and cinematic _Ken Burns_ imagery.
- **Fluid Custom Cursor:** A sophisticated "Ring & Dot" pointer with mix-blend-mode: difference, ensuring high visibility and brand personality across all screen sections.
- **Winery/Wedding Duality:** Seamless atmosphere switching, adapting the UI from a warm winery palette to a clean, ethereal wedding aesthetic.
- **Experience Hub:** An interactive, accordion-style booking interface for tours, seasonal events, and lifestyle experiences, optimized for conversion.
